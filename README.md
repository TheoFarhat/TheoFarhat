### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello guys, Hyd? my name is ThÃ©o Cohen Farhat, I have 18 years old and I'm currently in my first period of Computer Science at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 
I am searching for a complete and critical formation in the tecnology and information area.

Experience in Python and Swift.

I'm interested in Artifical Intelligence, Blockchain, Web 3.0 and the metaverse.

I'm currently working on an app called "ToCoFomi". It was an app created during an IBM program called "HackaTruck MakerPlace" in Switch Language. 
However, a professor of my university really liked the app and invited my group to present the project at an event as a startup. 
Hence, my group is working to transform "ToCoFomi" into Dart language, so we can build the app both in IOS and Android.
